    "1. Execution Algorithms:\n",
    "These algorithms focus on executing trades in a smart and cost-effective way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Trend-following Algorithms:\n",
    "These algorithms try to find and take advantage of price trends in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mean Reversion Algorithms:\n",
    "These algorithms look for situations where prices have moved too much and are likely to go back to their average values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Market-making Algorithms:\n",
    "These algorithms help keep the market running smoothly by providing both buying and selling options for traders.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Arbitrage Algorithms:\n",
    "These algorithms look for price differences between different markets and try to profit from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Statistical Forecasting Algorithms:\n",
    "These algorithms use historical data to make predictions about future price movements.\n",

    "q: what are the inputs, features, outputs?\n",
    "#### 2. develop a hypothesis for a strategy \n",
    "#### 3. backtest the strategy\n",
    "backtesting means testing the trading strategy way back in time to see if it works as expected\n",
    "#### 4. implement on current dataset"
